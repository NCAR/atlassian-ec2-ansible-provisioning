# The Amazon Linux 2 Ansible package is 2.4, which has issue
# interacting with RDS, so use pipenv to install a known-good version.
# Another alternative here would be nix, however that has issues
# installing as root, and can be slow in practice.

# Luckily AmazonLinux2 and Ubuntu use the same package name for
# pip. This may need some logic if other distros are added. Note:
# Parsing /etc/os-release is probably a good starting point for that.
./bin/pacapt install --noconfirm python-pip

# See Pipfile and Pipfile.lock.
pip install pipenv
pipenv sync
