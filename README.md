# Atlassian Data-Center Installation Automation

## Introduction

This repository is a suite of Ansible roles, playbooks and support scripts to
automate the installation and maintenance of Atlassian Data-Center products in
cloud environments.

## Usage

### Cloud DC-node deployment playbooks

The usual scenario for usage as part of a cloud deployment is to invoke the
script as part of post-creation actions invoked while a new product node is
being brought up. In the case of AWS, this would usually be done by
[cfn-init][cfn-init]/[user-data][ec2-user-data]. For example, the [Jira
quickstart template][jira-cfn-tmpl] creates a per-node [launch
configuration][ec2-launch-config] that fetches this repository and runs the
appropriate AWS/product playbook, which invokes the appropriate roles.

In practice, the Ansible roles require some information about the infrastructure
that was deployed (e.g. RDS endpoint/password). The way this is currently
achieved (on AWS) is that have the CloudFormation template dump this information
into the file `/etc/atl` as `RESOURCE_VAR=<resource>` lines. This can be then
sourced as environment variables to be retrieved at runtime . See the
helper-script `bin/ansible-with-atl-env` and the corresponding
`groups_vars/aws_node_local.yml` var-file.

### Maintenance playbooks

## Development philosophy

The suite is intended to consist of a number of small, composable roles that can
be combined together into playbooks. Wherever possible the roles should be
platform-agnostic as possible, with platform-specific functionality broken out
into more specific roles.

Where possible the roles are also product-agnostic (e.g. downloads), with more
specific functionality added in later product-specific roles.

Roles should be reasonably self-contained, with sensible defaults configured in
`<role>/defaults/main.yml` and overridden by the playbook at runtime. Roles may
implicitly depend on variables being defined elsewhere where they cannot define
them natively (e.g. the `jira_config` role depends on the `atl_cluster_node_id`
var being defined; on AWS this is provided by the `aws_common` role, which
should be run first).

## Ansible layout

* Helper scripts are in `bin/`. In particular the `bin/ansible-with-atl-env`
  wrapper is of use during AWS node initialisation. See _Usage_ above for more
  information.
* Inventory files are under `inv/`. For AWS `cfn-init` the inventory
  `inv/aws_node_local` inventory is probably what you want.
 * Note that this expects the environment to be setup with infrastructure
   information; see _Usage_ above.
* Global group vars loaded automatically from `group_vars/<group>.yml`. In
  particular note `group_vars/aws_node_local.yml` which loads infrastructure
  information from the environment.
* Roles are under `roles/`
 * Platform specific roles start with `<platform-shortname>_...`,
   e.g. `roles/aws_common/`.
 * Similarly, product-specific roles should start with `<product>_...`.
